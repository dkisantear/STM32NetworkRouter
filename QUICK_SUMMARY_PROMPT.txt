I'm working on a latency monitoring system with STM32 → Raspberry Pi → Azure → Frontend architecture.

## ✅ Completed Changes:

1. **Frontend**: Updated Main Server card to show STM32 connection status (replaced simulated latency). Styling matches Pi Gateway status pill exactly (same colors, simple format).

2. **Backend**: Azure Function `/api/stm32-status` with Table Storage. Handles GET/POST with 15s timeout.

3. **Pi Scripts**: Bridge script (`pi_stm32_bridge.py`) reads UART and POSTs to Azure. UART test script confirms STM32 is sending "STM32_ALIVE" messages successfully.

## 🔧 Current Issue:

Bridge script is not receiving UART messages even though `pi_uart_test.py` successfully receives "STM32_ALIVE" messages when run manually.

## 📋 What I Need:

1. **STM32 Integration**: Verify STM32 code is actually flashed and continuously sending "STM32_ALIVE\n" every 1 second via USART2 at 38400 baud.

2. **Bridge Script Debugging**: Why does the test script receive messages but bridge script doesn't? Both use same UART device/baud. Check if:
   - Bridge script is running when STM32 is connected
   - Reading logic differs between scripts
   - Port conflicts (test vs bridge)

3. **Complete Pipeline Verification**: Ensure STM32 → Pi → Azure → Frontend works end-to-end.

Files: `pi_stm32_bridge.py`, `pi_uart_test.py`, `api/stm32-status/index.js`, `src/components/LatencyCard.tsx`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY_PROMPT.md` has full details.

Please help diagnose why bridge script isn't receiving UART messages and suggest fixes.
